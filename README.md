# Annotators

Work on 16.5.18

Got a blink about REST apis.... Just done with response class and tried how to generate JSON/ XML responses.

Worked with different Annotators as,

      Path with all possible options
      
      consumes
      
      produces- to get and put different likes img,txt,pdf
      
      Get and Post
      
Learnt how to use the REST front end Tool-POSTMAN with multiple options as,

      raw data, json, plain text, etc.,.
